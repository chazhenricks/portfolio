        Adding things to this site after 4 years

      <h2>Its been forever since I've updated this site.</h2>
      <p>
        I want to do that more often. There is a lot of stuff I know how to do -
        and theres also a l lot of stuff I think I know how to do, but probably
        don't because I've never taught it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I spent an afternoon getting all the credentials and logins and stuff
        set up so I can make updates here. The process was more straightforward
        than I thought.
      </p>

      <h3>Domain Name Registrars and Hosting Servers</h3>
      <p>
        I bought the domain name from Namecheap and use a Digital Ocean droplet
        to host it. I needed to make sure I had logins to both places to I could
        make any updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Namecheap is the Domain Registrar. They are the broker that you purchase
        a domain name from and are the intermediary that tells the big Dot Com
        Database in the sky that "chazhenricks.com" maps to a server address
        somewhere. Because most of the access to the Internet is controlled by
        <a href="https://www.icann.org/"> three kids in a trenchcoat </a> - we
        need an intermediary to act on our behalf to tell The Internet that a
        new website exists. In reality, The Internet is just a big Database and
        we need to pay someone to get a new record added to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more important thing I needed to be able to do is ssh into the
        hosting server to make some updates. The hosting server is some other
        computer that is accessable to the intrnet via an IP address. When you
        "ssh" into a server, you are connecting to it remotely from your
        computer. So I can access the terminal from that computer via the
        terminal on my computer. The way we can do this without having to
        constantly type in passwords is by creating an "ssh key" - which is a
        public/private pair of Computer Science Wizardry. You can think of it
        like two sides of a BFF necklace. You have one side that no one is
        allowed to see. You give the other side to this remote server. Then you
        tell the server "dont let anyone in here if they dont have my side of
        the BFF necklace." This effectively makes it very hard for someone thats
        not you to login to the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last part was to update the website that was already being served. I
        made this when I was still just learning about web development - so its
        all pretty much a basic HTML/CSS site. Theres not a framework or
        anything (though I admit that there is a little bit of jQuery). I just
        needed to add a section for writing, port my notes over to an HTML file,
        add some anchor tags, and baby you got a stew goin again! I like the
        idea of doing as much of this as possible with no frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope to keep a more regular log of "dumb shit I figured out so
        hopefully we can be less dumb together" note on here as I fuck around
        with webservers and other fun things.
